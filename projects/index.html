<p><b>PROJECT EPIC (2009-present)</b>  </p>

Project EPIC was launched on 2009 and EPIC stands for <b>"Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis"</b>. Project EPIC is a multi-disciplinary research effort that creates a venue for researchers from various fields such as Software Engineering, Natural Language Processing, and Human-Centered Computing to conduct their research. Project EPIC researchers study "How members of the public make use of social media during times of crisis".</p>

<p><li><b>EPIC Analyze (2013-present)</b> </li> </p>
<p>The Epic Analyze project is one of the sub projects in Project EPIC. Epic Analyze is a data analytics web application to support crisis informatics research. The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a platform that provide browsing, searching, filtering, sampling, and annotating of large-scale social media datasets collected during mass emergency events. </p>

<p><li><b>ISM (2014-present)</b> </li> </p>
<p> Project EPIC tweet datasets are collected during mass emergencies from Twitter microblogging service. Dataset collections can be active for months.  Sorting active datasets in the incremental fashion is challenging. In order to provide incremental sorting for Project EPIC active datasets, incremental sorting method (ISM) is developed. 
ISM sorts newly collected event tweets and incrementally appends them into existing event's dataset with providing entire sorted set and without changing existing tweets status. Also, ISM supports data analytics by providing efficient and fast sorting, searching, filtering for large-scale datasets collected during mass emergency events.

<h4>Past Projects</h4>
<hr>
<br>
<p><b> Recommendation System Project (Spring 2013) </b> </p> 

<p> Recommendation System Project was the final project of CSCI 5502 Data Mining class. The main objective was to build a book recommendation system. During the course of the project following algorithms are implemented: User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) Algorithm, User-based CF Improved Algorithm , and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) User-based CF Algorithm. </p>

<p><i> Developer: </i> Ahmet Arif Aydin</p>
<br>
<p><b>Android Application Project (Fall 2012) </b></p> 
<p>

Android Application Project was the final project of CSCI 5448 Object-Oriented Analysis and Design class and its purpose was to create an android application (Collaborator) that allows collaborative groups to monitor and share progress. Groups may be formed for reasons such as completing a project, summarizing readings or answering textbook questions.</p>
<p><i> Supervisor:</i> Prof. Ken Anderson</p>
<p><i> Developers:</i> Greg Guyles and Ahmet Arif Aydin</p>
 
<br>

<p><b>Masters' Degree Project (Spring 2012) </b> </p>
<p>
The main objective of the project was to implement sequential, parallel and hybrid Radix Sort algorithms and compare their performance. In the project, C++ programming language was used and parallel version's of algorithms were implemented by OpenMP API.
